Some common CI checks and how to fix them (if failing):
- The formatting in all files is consistent with the project's style.
   - Run `npm run format` to automatically format all files.
- The `examples/README.md` file contains all Quint files in `examples/`
  and correctly lists their ability to go through pipeline stages.
   - Run `make examples` to automatically regenerate this file locally.
- The assets in `quint/testFixture` and `doc/builtin.md` are consistent.
   - Run `npm run generate` to automatically update these files locally.
