If you've ever tried to debug a consensus implementation, you know the frustration: your algorithm is stuck, but the logs show hundreds of steps that obscure what's actually happening. You're drowning in implementation details when what you really need to understand is whether enough validators have voted to move to the next phase.

Consensus algorithms are among the hardest distributed systems problems to solve correctly, so you don't want to debug them in production. This is exactly why formal specification matters: you need to catch algorithmic errors before deployment. But writing good consensus specifications requires choosing the right level of abstraction.

There are some best practices that are useful to know. In this post we talk about one of them, the message soup, and how it helps you to focus on the core of consensus mechanism. We'll explore the message soup pattern, demonstrate its benefits through a comparison of specification approaches, and show how it leads to more analyzable consensus specifications.


## Recent consensus specifications

Consensus algorithms have recently gained novel attention, with Malachite, Alpenglow, Espresso, and MonadBFT, Minimmit, ChonkyBFT being just some example projects. Did you know that all of them have a Quint specification? You'll find a list with links at the bottom of this post.

We have written some of these specifications for newly announced algorithms. For Solana's Alpenglow and Category Lab's MonadBFT we have taken a straight-forward approach: we have specified in Quint what was written in the original papers.

## Doing is better than reading
Reading about consensus algorithms in papers is one thing, but actually specifying them is where the real magic happens. This blog post gives you the soup recipe, but the best you can do is try it with your own favorite algorithm.

For the hands-on experience, you'll need:
- [Install](../getting-started) Quint (TLDR: `npm i @informalsystems/quint -g`)
- Give Quint a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/informalsystems/quint) (this is a very important step!)
- Clone our [MonadBFT repository](https://github.com/informalsystems/monad-spec)


As we discussed in the [previous post](https://quint-lang.org/posts/alpenglow), a big value we get out of specs is that they help us to understand the algorithm. So let's do this exercise again, and let Quint generate example traces where a block has been finalized. Upon inspecting the trace produced by Monad's initial specifications, we can see that the detailed bookkeeping of every received message resulted in verbose output of 26 states displayed over 126k lines - you'd be scrolling a lot to read even a single state. In contrast, the trace for Alpenglow was concise enough to be easily displayed in the previous post.

While we would say that these consensus algorithms are more or less comparable, the specifications seem to differ significantly in terms of usability and efficiency. The reason is that the Alpenglow specification uses actions that are guarded by predicates over the **message soup**, while the Monad spec is doing **explicit bookkeeping**. Wait! What does all that mean?

## The message soup design pattern vs. explicit bookkeeping

Let's look a bit at the structure of the actions. As we already have seen in the previous post, in the Alpenglow specification we have actions like `blockNotarizedAction(v, slot)`, which is enabled when 60% of the voting power have sent a notar vote. In more detail, all messages that are sent are stored (forever) in a variable `msgBuffer`. This is the famous message soup; one set that contains all message that were ever sent.

This is a modeling trick. Production systems never work this way: messages travel over network stacks and disappear once received. However, production nodes do store information about received messages, making the local state an imperfect snapshot of network history.

Node actions are based on this stored history; there's one level of indirection through receiving and storing. In specifications, we can eliminate this indirection. Instead of defining actions based on local state (which depends on network history), we can define them directly based on network history: the message soup.

Observe that `blockNotarizedAction(v, slot)` is guarded by a predicate over the message soup (has 60% of the voting power voted), and this predicate is evaluated by the Quint simulator. What is happening here effectively is that all the bookkeeping that an implementation is doing (reading messages one-by-one, storing it, eliminating duplicates, pruning etc.) is abstracted away, and only the **effect** of the bookkeeping is visible in a Quint run. This is a good thing, if we don't care too much about the bookkeeping. Remember, we don't want all the details that the logs of a testnet would give to us.

<Callout type="info">
There are specific questions, e.g., when you want to focus on optimization in the bookkeeping implementation or want to focus on specifics in which order predicates should be evaluated, where modeling bookkeeping makes a lot of sense (we have done it in the driver and voterkeeper specs for Malachite). But for analyzing the core consensus algorithm it is good practice that these specifics should be abstracted.
</Callout>

In contrast, the Monad spec has the action `receive_message`. Most of the time, this action doesn't do anything interesting: it just stores that it has received a message. Only when the number of received messages surpasses a given threshold, the action does something interesting, like sending a message or finalizing a block. In contrast, the `blockNotarizedAction(v, slot)` always does something interesting, but it happens more rarely. Observe that `receive_message` actually pulls all the bookkeeping within the specification, and its state space. So we have a level detail here in the specification, that we don't really care about, and which actually gets in our way, when wanting to analyze the core consensus mechanism.

Let's be clear. This is not about comparing the two consensus algorithms. The point we are discussing here is a matter of abstraction in the specification. To not compare apples and oranges in the remainder of the post, and to not give the wrong impression that we compare different algorithms, we have refactored MonadBFT to also work on the message soup. This has allowed us to analyze interesting scenarios that we couldn't do with our first attempt of specifying it.

## Cooking the soup: from single messages to quorum transitions
The recipe to go from explicit bookkeeping to the message soup pattern is surprisingly simple. Take any place where you need a quorum of messages to trigger some effect and, instead of modeling each message arrival individually, just model the moment when the quorum threshold is crossed. You skip all the intermediate states where you've received some messages but not enough, and jump straight to "threshold reached, action taken."
This works particularly well for MonadBFT because it's already structured around quorum-driven events. Vote quorums create `QCs`, timeout quorums create `TCs`, and these certificates drive the consensus protocol forward. In our refactored specification, each certificate formation becomes one atomic transition rather than a series of incremental message processing steps.
In the example below, we sketch how a simplified vote handling function can be easily refactored to operate on the message soup:

```quint /VoteMsg/ /Transition/
pure def upon_vote_msg(vote: VoteMsg, s: LocalState): Transition =
  if (s.is_leader() and s.is_valid(vote))
    val s1 = s.add_vote(vote)
    if (s1.get_votes(vote.id).size() >= Q)
      val qc = s1.build_qc(vote.id)
      val p = s1.build_proposal(qc)
      { postState: s1, effects: Set(BroadcastProp(p)) }
    else
      nop(s1)
  else
    nop(s)
```

got refactored into:

```quint /Set[VoteMsg]/ /Set[Transition]/
pure def upon_vote_quorum(vote_soup: Set[VoteMsg], s: LocalState): Set[Transition] =
  if (s.is_leader())
    vote_soup
      .filter(v => s.is_valid(v))
      .groupBy(v => v.id)
      .values()
      .filter(q => q.size() >= Q)
      .map(votes => {
        val qc = s.build_qc(vote.id)
        val p = s.build_proposal(qc)
        { postState: s, effects: Set(BroadcastProp(p)) }
      })
  else
    Set(nop(s))
```

Now let's compare the two MonadBFT specifications: the original with explicit bookkeeping versus our refactored version using the message soup pattern. To compare the performance of the two approaches, we use a set of witnesses. A witness is something that we expect to hold in at least one state in one execution. We can then ask the Quint simulator whether it can find a trace that leads to a state that is described by the witness. We conducted 2 sets of experiments that answer these questions: How fast can a simulation for the model find a specific witness "once"? What is the frequency of witness observation across multiple samples?

The witnesses we use in our experiments explore different scenarios. Some are quite easy to construct in short executions, like a simple case where a proposal is reproposed. Others are more complex scenarios that require longer executions to be observed.

## Long Story Short
Remember how we said the message soup approach skips intermediate states? Well, this shows up dramatically in the traces. The same consensus scenario where a reproposal is observed that takes on average **37 steps with the message soup needed 500+ steps in the original bookkeeping version**. That's not just an optimization, it's the difference between seeing the consensus logic clearly versus getting lost in translation, when looking at the output Quint generates. Even if you are using LLMs to parse and explain the traces for you, this can make it focus on what you really want to understand instead of drowning in message-handling mechanics.

## The Need for Speed
The message soup version finds witnesses **at least 3x faster** than the bookkeeping approach, and that's in the worst case. For more complex scenarios, the message-per-message version would often time out or run out of memory entirely while the message soup version sailed through. This speed matters because faster executions mean faster debugging cycles and more extensive coverage of the state space. When you can explore more scenarios in the same amount of time, you're establishing more trust in your system. More speed, more trust, more sleep.

## When the Soup Gets Spicy: Byzantine Faults

A powerful trick to model byzantine behavior is to simply pre-populate the message soup with all messages that byzantine nodes could ever send without modeling complex byzantine node logic. (We have used this in our earlier [blog post on Alpenglow](https://quint-lang.org/posts/alpenglow), where we wanted to analyze the issue of having too many faults.)
The message soup approach handles the load that comes with this technique more elegantly than explicit bookkeeping: because our system only makes transitions on enabled steps, having a huge number of possibilities for byzantine messages doesn't cause combinatorial explosion. In the bookkeeping approach, every byzantine message creates a new state transition that the system has to explore, leading to exponential blow-up.

The plot below shows resilience to byzantine messages injection. We can see that the frequency of observing witnesses is unaffected for the message soup approach, but the bookkeeping version fails to maintain this resilience. In the single-message version, there's a massive gap between the Byzantine and honest scenarios. Byzantine conditions severely degrade performance while the message soup approach shows barely any difference.

When you're dealing with adversarial networks, what doesn't kill your protocol makes it stronger. The message soup cuts through the byzantine noise and helps you focus on what really matters: is your design still safe when under attack?
